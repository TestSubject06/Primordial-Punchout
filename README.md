[AS3] Ludum Dare 24, Theme - Evolution

So what evolves better than slime? Nothing, that's what. The idea here is simple. You're a slime in a test chamber, and you're being granted small upgrades, and pitted against other slimes to be the best of the best! There are a few things that never got finished this time around. I spent a lot of time on the animations for the various slimes, but never actually got the time to put in the sound effects. There are sounds in the files, but they were never implemented in time to be submitted. This one was a lot of fun to make, and I would like to add more to it and finish it later on. Ranked #61 Overall of 1406.
